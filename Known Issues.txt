This document contains a list of known issues which may or may not be addressed with a future update.

    * The installer only has partial support for the XDG Base directory scheme. Paths to the XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_DATA_HOME directories are hard coded. The install script however does contain variables which can be changed accordingly to match your needs.

    * Clock Chimes does not detect whether "Do not disturb" or any mechanism to silence notifications is active.
    * Clock Chimes does not detect whether any media player is already active. See the MUTING GUIDE for a suggested work around to dynamically silence Clock Chimes.

    * Clock Chimes sometimes unexpectedly plays chimes after waking the computer from suspend or hibernation. See question 15 in Questions and Answers.txt for more information.

    * The exit code is 0 regardless of whether Clock Chimes plays a chime, silent, or muted.
